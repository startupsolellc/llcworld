            "content_html": "<p>The process of obtaining an <strong>Employer Identification Number (EIN)</strong> is crucial, especially for <strong>non-US residents</strong> forming an LLC in the United States. Without an EIN, your business <strong>cannot open a bank account, register with payment gateways like PayPal, or operate on marketplaces.</strong></p>\n<p>However, many applicants have recently <strong>experienced unexpected delays</strong> due to <strong>IRS <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/employer-identification-number#:~:text=International%20EIN%20applicants,9471%20(outside%20the%20U.S.).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIN application</a> processing backlogs</strong>. This article will cover <strong>the reasons behind EIN delays</strong>, how they impact businesses, and the best ways to handle these challenges.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Understanding IRS EIN Application Delays</strong></h2>\n<p>Since <strong>December 2024</strong>, there has been a surge in EIN processing times, particularly affecting non-US applicants. We have personally experienced delays with EIN applications for multiple LLC formations and, after researching the issue and contacting the IRS, we have identified several key reasons for the backlog:</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Are EIN Applications Delayed?</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>High Application Volume</strong> ‚Äì A significant increase in EIN applications has overwhelmed IRS processing systems.</li>\n<li><strong>End-of-Year Tax Season Workload</strong> ‚Äì As in previous years, the IRS experiences <strong>high demand at the end of each year</strong>, slowing down operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Winter Storm Disruptions</strong> ‚Äì A <strong>massive <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/winter-weather/winter-storm-60-million-americans-cold-snow-ice-polar-vortex-rcna186272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer\">snowstorm in early 2025</a></strong> affected multiple states, shutting down offices and causing significant processing delays.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>üí°Among all these factors, <strong>the most critical cause of the EIN processing backlog has been the winter storm at the beginning of the year</strong>. This extreme weather event led to widespread office closures across multiple states, bringing IRS operations to a standstill. As a result, EIN application processing <strong>slowed down dramatically</strong>, making this <strong>the primary reason behind the extended delays</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How EIN Delays Impact Businesses</strong></h2>\n<p>Extended EIN processing times can create serious challenges for business owners, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Delayed Business Launch</strong> ‚Äì Without an EIN, your LLC <strong>cannot open a bank account or set up payment processing.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Compliance Risks</strong> ‚Äì Running a business without an EIN <strong>can lead to regulatory and tax compliance issues.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Operational Challenges</strong> ‚Äì Businesses relying on EIN approval <strong>to finalize their setup and contracts may face financial setbacks.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How to Get Your EIN Faster</strong></h2>\n<p>If you <strong>formed your LLC in late 2024 or early 2025</strong> and are <strong>still waiting for your EIN</strong>, here‚Äôs what you should do:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Fastest Solution: Call the IRS</strong></h3>\n<p>The <strong>quickest way to get an EIN</strong> as a <strong>non-US resident</strong> is by calling the <strong>IRS EIN helpline</strong>. Here‚Äôs how:</p>\n<p>üìû <strong>IRS Phone Number for Non-US Applicants:</strong> <strong><a href=\"tel:+1 (800) 829-4933\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">+1 (800) 829-4933</a></strong></p>\n<h4><strong>Steps to Get Your EIN Over the Phone:</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prepare Your SS-4 Form</strong> ‚Äì Keep a copy of your <strong>SS-4 application form</strong> nearby, as the IRS agent will verify the details.</li>\n<li><strong>Dial the IRS Number</strong> and follow the menu options:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Press \"1\" for English</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Press \"3\" for EIN confirmation &amp; lost EIN services</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Be Persistent</strong> ‚Äì If the waiting time is too long, don‚Äôt give up. Call again at a different time.</li>\n<li><strong>Request Your EIN</strong> ‚Äì Tell the representative that you <strong>have already faxed your SS-4 form multiple times but have not received your EIN.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Ask for an Immediate EIN</strong> ‚Äì If possible, request <strong>to receive your EIN directly over the phone.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Request a 147C Letter</strong> ‚Äì This <strong>official EIN confirmation letter</strong> can be faxed to you after the call.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>üîπ <strong>Important:</strong> If the authorized aerson asks for a <strong>Social Security Number (SSN)</strong>, let them know that you <strong>are a foreign applicant without an SSN but own a US-based business.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>2. Alternative Method: Resend Your SS-4 Form</strong></h3>\n<p>If you <strong>don‚Äôt want to call the IRS</strong>, your next best option is <strong>to re-fax your SS-4 form</strong>:</p>\n<p>‚úÖ <strong>Fax Your SS-4 Form Again</strong> ‚Äì Send it every <strong>7 days</strong> until you receive a response.<br>‚úÖ <strong>Mark It as a Follow-Up</strong> ‚Äì On the first page, write <strong>‚ÄúSecond Request‚Äù</strong> before faxing it. If faxing again, use <strong>‚ÄúThird Request‚Äù</strong> and so on.<br>‚úÖ <strong>Prevent Multiple EINs</strong> ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt mark it as a follow-up, the IRS may <strong>process it as a new EIN request</strong>, causing duplicate EINs. This could lead to compliance issues and unnecessary complications.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Preventing Future EIN Application Delays</strong></h2>\n<p>While EIN delays may persist, <strong>planning ahead</strong> can help mitigate their impact. Here‚Äôs what you can do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plan Early</strong> ‚Äì If your business relies on an EIN, apply at least <strong>2-3 months in advance</strong> of any critical business operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Ensure Accuracy</strong> ‚Äì <strong>Incomplete or incorrect applications cause additional delays.</strong> Double-check your SS-4 form before submitting.</li>\n<li><strong>Track Your Application</strong> ‚Äì <strong>Call the IRS periodically</strong> to check your EIN status and follow up on delayed applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>The <strong>recent IRS EIN application delays</strong> have created significant hurdles for <strong>international entrepreneurs and non-US LLC owners</strong>. By understanding the root causes and applying proactive solutions, you can <strong>reduce waiting times and keep your business on track.</strong></p>\n<p>üí° <strong>Need help forming your US LLC and obtaining an EIN?</strong> Check out our latest guides on <strong>LLCWorld.net</strong> for expert assistance! üöÄ</p>",

Why is Wyoming a popular state for forming an LLC?</strong></h4>\n<p>Wyoming offers <strong>low fees, strong privacy protections, and tax advantages</strong>, making it one of the best states to form an LLC. The <strong>$60 annual report fee</strong> is affordable, and there is <strong>no state income tax</strong>. Additionally, Wyoming allows <strong>anonymous ownership</strong>, which is a major benefit for business owners who want privacy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>2. Can a non-U.S. resident start an LLC in Wyoming?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes! Wyoming has <strong>no residency requirement</strong>, meaning <strong>non-U.S. residents</strong> can easily form an LLC without a U.S. address or Social Security Number (SSN).</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>3. Do I need a U.S. address to form an LLC in Wyoming?</strong></h4>\n<p>No. If you don‚Äôt have a U.S. address, you can use a <strong>Registered Agent service</strong> like <strong>Northwest Registered Agent</strong>, which provides a <strong>business address for LLC formation</strong>. This address can be used for state filings and official documents.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>4. How much does it cost to form an LLC in Wyoming?</strong></h4>\n<p>The total cost to form an LLC in Wyoming is <strong>$143</strong>, which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$104 state filing fee</strong></li>\n<li><strong>$39 filing service fee</strong> (via Northwest Registered Agent)<br>The <strong>first year of Registered Agent service is free</strong>, but after the first year, it costs <strong>$125 per year</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>5. What happens if I don‚Äôt file my Wyoming LLC‚Äôs annual report?</strong></h4>\n<p>Wyoming <strong>automatically dissolves your LLC</strong> if you fail to file the annual report ($60) by the due date. This can be beneficial if you decide to <strong>close your business</strong>, as you don‚Äôt need to go through a formal dissolution process‚Äîjust stop paying the annual report fee.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>6. Why is Wyoming LLC a great choice for Amazon, Etsy, and other marketplaces?</strong></h4>\n<p>Many online marketplaces like <strong>Amazon, Etsy, and Shopify</strong> require sellers to have a <strong>business address</strong>. Wyoming LLCs allow business owners to use their <strong>Registered Agent‚Äôs address</strong> for official business registration, avoiding the need for a personal U.S. address.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>7. Do I need a unique suite address for Amazon, Etsy, or Shopify?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes, some platforms require a <strong>unique suite address</strong> to prevent multiple sellers from using the same business address. Wyoming mail forwarding services allow you to purchase a <strong>unique suite number</strong>, making it easier to comply with platform requirements.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>8. Does Wyoming have business taxes for LLCs?</strong></h4>\n<p>No, Wyoming does <strong>not</strong> impose:<br>‚úÖ State income tax<br>‚úÖ Corporate tax<br>‚úÖ Gross receipts tax<br>However, you may still need to file <strong>federal taxes</strong> with the IRS.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>9. How long does it take to form an LLC in Wyoming?</strong></h4>\n<p>Wyoming LLC formation typically takes <strong>3-5 business days</strong> when filing online. Some filings may be approved faster.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>10. Does Wyoming offer anonymity for LLC owners?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes! Wyoming allows <strong>anonymous LLC ownership</strong>, meaning your name does not appear in public records. Instead, only your Registered Agent‚Äôs address and information are listed, providing an extra layer of privacy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>11. Can I open a U.S. business bank account with a Wyoming LLC?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes! Many U.S. banks and fintech platforms allow <strong>non-U.S. residents</strong> to open business accounts using a Wyoming LLC. Recommended options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mercury</strong> ‚Äì Best for startups</li>\n<li><strong>Payoneer</strong> ‚Äì Ideal for freelancers and eCommerce sellers</li>\n<li><strong>Wise Business</strong> ‚Äì Great for international transactions</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>12. Does Wyoming require an operating agreement for LLCs?</strong></h4>\n<p>No, Wyoming <strong>does not legally require</strong> an <strong>Operating Agreement</strong>, but it is highly recommended. If you use <strong>Northwest Registered Agent</strong>, they provide a <strong>free, pre-drafted Operating Agreement</strong> for your LLC.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>13. Can I use a Wyoming LLC for dropshipping?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes! Wyoming LLCs are popular for <strong>dropshipping businesses</strong> because of:<br>‚úÖ <strong>No state income tax</strong><br>‚úÖ <strong>Low annual fees</strong><br>‚úÖ <strong>Privacy protections</strong><br>‚úÖ <strong>Easy business banking access</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>14. Can I dissolve my Wyoming LLC easily?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes! Wyoming <strong>automatically dissolves</strong> your LLC if you do not pay the <strong>$60 annual report fee</strong>. If you need a formal dissolution, you can file the <strong>Articles of Dissolution</strong> online for just <strong>$60</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>15. Does Wyoming LLC require a business license?</strong></h4>\n<p>Wyoming does <strong>not</strong> require a <strong>general business license</strong>, but <strong>certain businesses</strong> may need <strong>special permits</strong> (e.g., food sales, professional services). Always check with the <strong>Wyoming Secretary of State</strong> to confirm if your business needs additional licensing.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Choose LLC Formation Service for Your LLC?</strong></h3>\n<p>While it's possible to form an <strong>LLC in Wyoming</strong> on your own, the <strong>paperwork, compliance rules, and address requirements</strong> can be overwhelming‚Äîespecially for <strong>non-U.S. residents</strong>.

Unlike other providers, <strong>Northwest doesn‚Äôt sell your data</strong> to third parties.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>‚úÖ 7.

Without an EIN, a business cannot open a U.S. bank account, apply for Stripe or PayPal business accounts, or conduct legal business activities in the country. This guide will walk you through the EIN application process step-by-step, ensuring that you can obtain your EIN quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8r8\"><strong>What is an EIN?</strong></h2>\n<p>EIN stands for <strong>Employer Identification Number</strong>, sometimes referred to as a <strong>Federal Tax ID</strong>. It is a <strong>9-digit number</strong> assigned by the <strong>Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</strong> to identify a business for tax and reporting purposes. An EIN follows this format: <strong>XX-XXXXXXX</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8r9\"><strong>Why Do You Need an EIN?</strong></h3>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>An EIN is required for various business activities, including:</p>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p>Opening a <strong>U.S. business bank account</strong> (Mercury, Payoneer, Wise, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Registering with <strong>payment processors like Stripe or PayPal</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Filing U.S. <strong>tax returns</strong> if necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hiring employees in the U.S.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complying with IRS regulations for <strong>foreign-owned LLCs</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without an EIN, your LLC will not be able to legally operate in the U.S. financial system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8ra\"><strong>Can Non-US Residents Apply for an EIN?</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes! Whether you live inside or outside the U.S., if you own a U.S.-based LLC, you must obtain an EIN. The good news is that <strong>you do not need to be physically present in the U.S. to apply for an EIN</strong>. The process is completed remotely by submitting <strong>IRS Form SS-4</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8rb\"><strong>How to Apply for an EIN for Your LLC</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8rc\"><strong>Step 1: Download Form SS-4</strong></h3>\n<p>Before filling out the application, download the latest version of <strong>IRS Form SS-4</strong> from the official IRS website.

Since most people do not have access to a traditional fax machine, you can use an <strong>online fax service</strong> such as <strong>Fax Plus</strong>.</p>\n<p>üìå <strong>Suggested Virtual Fax Service: </strong><a href=\"https://app.fax.plus/invite/EYC6DMK\"><strong>Fax Plus</strong></a> <em>(starting at $5.99/month)</em></p>\n<p>You need to keep your fax service active until you receive your EIN, as IRS may send communications through fax if they require further verification.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8rh\"><strong>Step 4: Submit Form SS-4 to the IRS</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you have completed your SS-4 form, send it to the IRS via fax.</p>\n<p>üìå <strong>IRS Fax Number for EIN Applications:</strong> <strong>+1 855-641-6935</strong></p>\n<p>‚úÖ <strong>Submission Checklist:</strong></p>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p>Ensure <strong>SS-4 Form is correctly completed and signed</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attach your <strong>LLC formation documents</strong> (Articles of Organization/Certificate of Formation).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Double-check the fax number and confirm that the transmission was successful.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8ri\"><strong>Step 5: Wait for Your EIN Approval</strong></h3>\n<p>The IRS processes EIN applications within <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong>, but it may take longer depending on IRS workload. Your EIN confirmation letter (<strong>CP 575</strong>) will be mailed to the U.S. mailing address provided on Form SS-4. If you use a Registered Agent service, they will forward the document to you digitally.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to check your business address mailbox regularly for IRS notifications. If you provided a fax number, IRS might fax your EIN directly, written at the top of the SS-4 form.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8rj\"><strong>Applying for an EIN Without an SSN or ITIN</strong></h2>\n<p>Many non-U.S. residents worry about obtaining an EIN <strong>without an SSN or ITIN</strong>. Fortunately, an SSN or ITIN is <strong>not required</strong> to get an EIN for a foreign-owned LLC. Simply leave the <strong>SSN/ITIN field blank</strong> on Form SS-4.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8rk\"><strong>What If You Don‚Äôt Receive Your EIN?</strong></h2>\n<p>If your EIN does not arrive within <strong>six weeks</strong>, you can re-fax your SS-4 application to the IRS. Write <strong>‚ÄúSECOND REQUEST‚Äù</strong> at the top of the form and submit it again to the fax number listed above.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can contact the IRS EIN department at <strong>+1 267-941-1099</strong> (not toll-free) to inquire about your application status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8rl\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6cpc7k8rm\">1.

However, choosing the <strong>right state</strong> is crucial to optimizing taxes, reducing compliance burdens, and ensuring privacy. Since LLC regulations vary by state, selecting the best jurisdiction directly impacts your <strong>operational costs, tax obligations, and legal protections.</strong></p>\n<p>Some states offer <strong>business-friendly policies, low maintenance costs, and strong privacy protections</strong>, while others have <strong>higher fees and complex compliance requirements</strong> that may not be ideal for non-U.S. residents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqas8mt\"><strong>Why Does the State Matter for Your LLC?</strong></h3>\n<p>Unlike corporations, LLCs are <strong>state-registered entities</strong>, meaning that each U.S. state has its own set of rules, tax policies, and filing requirements. Choosing the wrong state could lead to unnecessary taxes, high annual fees, and complex legal obligations.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we will break down the <strong>best U.S. states for non-residents to form an LLC</strong>, comparing the key benefits, costs, and legal requirements to help you make an informed decision.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqas8mu\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><strong>Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a State for Your LLC</strong></h2>\n<p>Choosing the right state for your <strong>non-resident LLC</strong> involves evaluating several critical factors. Below are the most important considerations when deciding where to form your LLC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqas8mv\"><strong>1. Tax Structure: State Income Tax &amp; Franchise Tax</strong></h3>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>biggest tax advantage</strong> for non-U.S. residents is that they are generally <strong>not subject to state income tax</strong> unless they have a physical presence (nexus) in that state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Some states, like Wyoming and Florida, have no state income tax</strong>‚Äîmaking them ideal for foreign entrepreneurs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Certain states charge a <strong>franchise tax</strong>, which is an annual tax imposed on LLCs simply for existing. Examples include:</p>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>California:</strong> $800 minimum franchise tax per year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> $300 annual franchise tax.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wyoming &amp; New Mexico:</strong> No franchise tax.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqas8n0\"><strong>2. Privacy and Anonymity Laws</strong></h3>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p>If privacy is a concern, <strong>Wyoming and New Mexico</strong> allow LLC owners to remain anonymous.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delaware provides some level of anonymity</strong>, but public filings include certain ownership details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqas8n1\"><strong>3. Annual Reporting and Compliance Requirements</strong></h3>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p>Some states have complex reporting requirements, while others are more relaxed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>New Mexico stands out</strong> as it does not require annual reports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wyoming, Delaware, and Florida have simple annual reporting requirements</strong> with low fees.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqas8n2\"><strong>4. Formation and Operating Costs</strong></h3>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p>The cost of forming an LLC varies by state.

Not Considering State Requirements for Marketplace Sellers</strong></h3>\n<p>For <strong>Amazon, Etsy, and Walmart</strong> sellers, the state of LLC formation plays a crucial role. These platforms often require a <strong>unique, verifiable business address</strong> during the account verification process.</p>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wyoming</strong> is one of the most <strong>cost-effective states</strong> that provides a <strong>unique suite number</strong> for business addresses, making it an ideal choice for marketplace sellers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choosing a state without a proper <strong>business mailing address option</strong> can lead to unnecessary complications when setting up seller accounts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqat8p1\"><strong>2.

Overlooking Privacy and Anonymity Considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>Many LLC owners seek <strong>privacy</strong> and wish to keep their information off public records, but they often choose states that do not provide strong anonymity protections.</p>\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wyoming and New Mexico</strong> allow anonymous LLC ownership, protecting your personal details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delaware does not offer true anonymity</strong>, as certain ownership details must be disclosed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><hr></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqat8p4\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqat8p5\">1.

Which states do not have state income tax?</h3>\n<p><strong>Wyoming, Florida, and Texas</strong> have no state income tax, making them attractive for non-residents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqat8p8\">4.

Can I use my home country‚Äôs address instead of a U.S. address for my LLC?</h3>\n<p>No, most <strong>marketplaces and banks require a U.S. business address</strong> for verification and compliance purposes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqat8pa\">6.

Do I need a registered agent for my LLC?</h3>\n<p>Yes, every LLC must have a <strong>registered agent with a physical address</strong> in the state of formation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ij6coqat8pe\">10.
