However, non-residents often struggle with account approval due to certain restrictions—especially the lack of an SSN or ITIN.</p><p>But here’s the good news: <strong>It is absolutely possible to create a Stripe account as a non-US resident!</strong> You just need to follow the right process. This guide will walk you through everything from forming a US LLC to obtaining an EIN and setting up a US bank account.</p><p>By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a fully functional Stripe account, legally verified and ready to accept payments from customers worldwide.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Learn in This Guide:</strong><br>✔️ Why a US LLC is essential for non-residents to open a Stripe account<br>✔️ Step-by-step instructions for forming your LLC, getting an EIN, and opening a US bank account<br>✔️ Common mistakes to avoid during the setup process<br>✔️ The easiest way to get your Stripe account approved</p><p>So, if you’re ready to <strong>unlock global payments</strong> with Stripe, let’s dive in! 🚀</p><h2><strong>What Is a US Stripe Account and Why Is It Important?</strong></h2><p>Stripe is one of the most popular and widely used online payment gateways, enabling businesses to accept payments from customers worldwide. It is known for its seamless integration, advanced fraud protection, and extensive developer-friendly features. Many US-based entrepreneurs and business owners can easily create a Stripe account with just a few clicks, using their <strong>Social Security Number (SSN)</strong> and a US-based bank account.</p><p>However, for <strong>non-US residents</strong>, the process is not that simple. Stripe operates in <strong>select countries</strong>, meaning that many entrepreneurs from unsupported regions are unable to create an account directly. This limitation prevents international business owners from <strong>legally</strong> accepting payments through one of the most trusted payment gateways in the world.</p><h3><strong>Why Can’t Non-US Residents Easily Open a Stripe Account?</strong></h3><p>The main reason non-US residents face difficulties with Stripe is the <strong>lack of a US business entity</strong> and <strong>the required tax identification numbers</strong>. Unlike US citizens who can sign up with their personal details, non-residents must provide:</p><p>✅ A <strong>registered US business</strong> (an LLC, in most cases)<br>✅ A <strong>US-based address</strong> for the business<br>✅ An <strong>Employer Identification Number (EIN)</strong> (a tax ID issued by the IRS)<br>✅ A <strong>US bank account</strong> for Stripe payouts</p><p>Without these elements, <strong>non-residents are not eligible for a US Stripe account</strong>. This is where <strong>forming a US LLC</strong> becomes essential—it allows foreign entrepreneurs to legally register a business in the US and qualify for a Stripe account without needing a <strong>Social Security Number (SSN) or ITIN</strong>.</p><h4><strong>How Can Non-US Residents Use Stripe?</strong></h4><p>Despite these restrictions, <strong>there is a way</strong> for non-residents to open a fully functional <strong>US Stripe account</strong>. By forming a <strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</strong> in a Stripe-supported state like <strong>New Mexico, Wyoming, or Delaware</strong>, and obtaining an <strong>EIN and US bank account</strong>, you can unlock the benefits of Stripe and start receiving payments internationally.</p><p>In the next section, we will explore the <strong>major advantages of having a US Stripe account</strong>, and why it’s worth considering for your global business. 🚀</p><h2><strong>Benefits of Having a US Stripe Account</strong></h2><p>If you're planning to expand your business globally, having a <strong>US Stripe account</strong> offers significant advantages. Stripe is a <strong>trusted and secure</strong> payment processor used by millions of businesses worldwide, and it provides a seamless way to <strong>accept online payments</strong>.</p><p>For <strong>non-US residents</strong>, opening a <strong>US Stripe account</strong> comes with unique benefits that can help scale your business efficiently.

Excellent Support &amp; Documentation</strong> 📚</h3><p>✔️ Stripe offers <strong>detailed documentation and tutorials</strong> to guide you through integrations, payments, and troubleshooting.<br>✔️ <strong>24/7 customer support</strong> ensures that you get assistance whenever you need it.</p><p>A <strong>US Stripe account</strong> is an <strong>invaluable tool for non-US entrepreneurs</strong>, making it easy to <strong>accept payments globally, integrate with various platforms, and grow your business</strong>.</p><p>Now that you understand the key advantages, let’s move on to the <strong>eligibility and requirements for non-US residents</strong> to open a Stripe account! 🚀</p><h2><strong>Can Non-US Citizens Use Stripe?</strong></h2><p>The short answer is: <strong>Yes! Non-US citizens can legally use Stripe</strong>—but there are specific <strong>requirements</strong> you must meet to get your account approved.

Instead, you will need to set up a <strong>US-based business entity</strong> and fulfill a few essential requirements.</p><p>Let’s break down the process step by step:</p><hr><h3>✅ <strong>How Can Non-US Residents Open a Stripe Account?</strong></h3><p>To successfully open a Stripe account as a <strong>non-US resident</strong>, you will need to complete the following steps:</p><h4><strong>1️⃣ Form a US LLC (Limited Liability Company)</strong></h4><p>✔️ Stripe requires a business entity registered in the US.<br>✔️ The most popular choice for non-residents is an <strong>LLC</strong> (Limited Liability Company).<br>✔️ Recommended states for forming an LLC: <strong>New Mexico, Wyoming, or Delaware</strong> (no state taxes for non-residents).<br>✔️ You do <strong>not</strong> need to live in the US or have a visa to start an LLC.</p><h4><strong>2️⃣ Obtain an EIN (Employer Identification Number)</strong></h4><p>✔️ After forming an LLC, you must apply for an <strong>EIN</strong> from the <strong>IRS (Internal Revenue Service)</strong>.<br>✔️ This tax identification number is required to open a US business bank account and register with Stripe.<br>✔️ You can apply for an EIN <strong>without an SSN or ITIN</strong>.</p><h4><strong>3️⃣ Open a US Business Bank Account</strong></h4><p>✔️ Stripe requires a <strong>US-based bank account</strong> to deposit your funds.<br>✔️ Some online banks and fintech platforms allow non-residents to open business bank accounts remotely.<br>✔️ Popular options: <strong>Mercury, Relay, Wise (formerly TransferWise)</strong>.</p><h4><strong>4️⃣ Complete Stripe’s Identity Verification Process</strong></h4><p>✔️ After setting up your LLC and business bank account, you can register for a <strong>US Stripe account</strong>.<br>✔️ Stripe will require <strong>identity verification</strong>, where you must submit:</p><ul><li>Your <strong>passport or national ID</strong></li><li>Your <strong>LLC details (company name, EIN, US address, etc.)</strong><br>✔️ The information you provide must be <strong>accurate and match your legal business details</strong> to ensure smooth approval.</li></ul><hr><h3><strong>🔹 Important Notes:</strong></h3><p>❗ Your personal address can be outside the US, but your <strong>business address must be a US-based address</strong> (provided by your registered agent).<br>❗ Stripe <strong>does not require a US phone number</strong>—you can use your <strong>own international phone number</strong>.<br>❗ It’s essential to <strong>use the correct business classification</strong> when registering with Stripe to avoid approval issues.</p><hr><p>While non-US citizens <strong>cannot open a Stripe account as individuals</strong>, they <strong>can</strong> do so through a <strong>legally registered US LLC</strong>.

Stripe requires businesses to provide <strong>specific legal and financial documents</strong> that are <strong>only available with a US-based business entity</strong>.</p><p>This means that <strong>forming a US LLC</strong> is <strong>the most effective and legitimate way</strong> for non-residents to get approved for a Stripe account.</p><p>Now, let’s go over the <strong>essential requirements</strong> for using Stripe as a non-US resident.</p><hr><h2><strong>Requirements for Using a US Stripe Account as a Non-Resident</strong></h2><p>To successfully create a <strong>US Stripe account</strong>, you need to fulfill <strong>four key requirements</strong>:</p><h3><strong>1️⃣ A US-Based Business (LLC Formation)</strong></h3><p>✔️ <strong>Non-US companies cannot register directly with Stripe</strong>—you need a <strong>US-registered LLC</strong>.<br>✔️ Forming an LLC is <strong>straightforward</strong> and can be done <strong>100% online</strong> without needing to visit the US.<br>✔️ The best states for non-residents are <strong>New Mexico, Wyoming, and Delaware</strong>, as they offer <strong>low costs, privacy protection, and no state taxes for foreign-owned LLCs</strong>.<br>✔️ An LLC provides <strong>legal protection</strong>, <strong>credibility</strong>, and ensures compliance with <strong>Stripe’s business registration requirements</strong>.</p><h3><strong>2️⃣ Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS</strong></h3><p>✔️ Stripe requires your business to have an <strong>EIN (Employer Identification Number)</strong>, which is issued by the <strong>IRS (Internal Revenue Service)</strong>.<br>✔️ You <strong>do not need a Social Security Number (SSN)</strong> to get an EIN.<br>✔️ The EIN is necessary to <strong>open a US business bank account</strong> and complete your <strong>Stripe verification process</strong>.</p><h3><strong>3️⃣ A US Business Bank Account</strong></h3><p>✔️ Stripe deposits funds into a <strong>US-based business bank account</strong>, so having one is mandatory.<br>✔️ Many online banking services allow <strong>non-residents to open a US business account remotely</strong> (e.g., <strong>Mercury, Relay, Wise</strong>).<br>✔️ Your <strong>business bank account must match your LLC details</strong>, ensuring that all transactions align with your legal entity.</p><h3><strong>4️⃣ Identity Verification &amp; Compliance with Stripe</strong></h3><p>✔️ Stripe will ask you to <strong>verify your identity</strong> during the registration process.<br>✔️ You need to submit a <strong>government-issued ID (passport or national ID)</strong> and your <strong>US LLC business details</strong>.<br>✔️ Your Stripe business profile must be <strong>set up correctly</strong>, ensuring all details are accurate to avoid delays or rejections.</p><hr><h3><strong>💡 LLC Formation: Easier Than You Think</strong></h3><p>Many non-residents assume forming an <strong>LLC in the US is complicated</strong>—but it’s actually <strong>a simple and structured process</strong>:</p><p>✅ <strong>Step 1:</strong> Register your <strong>US LLC</strong> online (takes <strong>1-2 days</strong> with a service like Northwest Registered Agent).<br>✅ <strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply for your <strong>EIN</strong> (can take <strong>4-6 weeks</strong>, but expedited services are available).<br>✅ <strong>Step 3:</strong> Open a <strong>US business bank account</strong> (you can apply remotely through online banking services).<br>✅ <strong>Step 4:</strong> Register for <strong>Stripe</strong>, complete verification, and start accepting payments worldwide.</p><p>Once your LLC is set up and all the requirements are met, <strong>getting approved for a Stripe account is easy and hassle-free!</strong> 🚀</p><p>In the next section, we will <strong>dive deeper into each requirement</strong>, starting with <strong>LLC formation and why it is the foundation of your Stripe account setup</strong>.</p><h3><strong>What is a US LLC and Why is it Essential for Non-US Residents Using Stripe?</strong></h3><p>If you’re a <strong>non-US resident</strong> looking to open a <strong>Stripe account</strong>, the first and most important step is <strong>forming a US LLC (Limited Liability Company)</strong>. Stripe requires a <strong>legally registered US business</strong> for non-residents, and an LLC is the <strong>most accessible and cost-effective</strong> option.</p><p>Now, let’s break down what an <strong>LLC is</strong>, why it’s <strong>the best choice for non-residents</strong>, and how it makes getting approved for Stripe <strong>easy and straightforward</strong>.</p><hr><h4><strong>✅ What is a US LLC?</strong></h4><p>A <strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</strong> is a <strong>legal business structure</strong> in the United States that offers:<br>✔️ <strong>Limited liability protection</strong> – Your personal assets remain separate from your business debts.<br>✔️ <strong>Pass-through taxation</strong> – Non-US residents don’t pay US corporate taxes unless they have a taxable presence in the US.<br>✔️ <strong>Business credibility</strong> – A registered LLC increases trust when working with US clients and global customers.</p><p>Unlike <strong>sole proprietorships</strong>, an LLC is treated as a <strong>separate legal entity</strong>, which is <strong>why Stripe recognizes it as a legitimate business</strong> for account registration.</p><hr><h4><strong>🌍 Why is an LLC the Best Choice for Non-US Residents?</strong></h4><p>If you’re a <strong>foreign entrepreneur</strong>, an LLC is the most <strong>practical</strong> way to set up a business in the US <strong>without physically being there</strong>. Here’s why:</p><p>✔️ <strong>No residency or visa required</strong> – You don’t need to live in the US to start or own an LLC.<br>✔️ <strong>No SSN or ITIN required</strong> – Unlike corporations, LLCs allow <strong>foreign owners</strong> to apply for an EIN (Employer Identification Number) without a Social Security Number (SSN).<br>✔️ <strong>Easier tax structure</strong> – Most non-US LLC owners only pay taxes in their own country, not in the US (if structured properly).<br>✔️ <strong>100% remote setup</strong> – You can register an LLC <strong>fully online</strong> without traveling to the US.</p><p>Once your <strong>LLC is formed</strong>, you can <strong>apply for an EIN, open a US business bank account, and register for Stripe</strong>—allowing you to <strong>legally receive payments from US and international customers</strong>.</p><hr><h4><strong>🛠️ How an LLC Helps You Get Approved for Stripe</strong></h4><p><strong>Without a US LLC, Stripe will not approve your account as a non-resident.</strong> Here’s how forming an LLC solves this issue:</p><p>❌ <strong>A company registered in your home country is NOT accepted by Stripe US.</strong><br>✅ <strong>A US-based LLC meets all of Stripe’s legal requirements for non-residents.</strong></p><p>Once your LLC is created, you’ll receive:<br>✔️ <strong>A registered business name</strong> – Needed for Stripe account verification.<br>✔️ <strong>A US business address</strong> – Provided by your registered agent, required for Stripe registration.<br>✔️ <strong>An EIN (Employer Identification Number)</strong> – Essential for business tax purposes and bank account setup.</p><p>With these details in place, your <strong>Stripe account setup will be smooth and straightforward</strong>.</p><hr><h4><strong>💡 Forming a US LLC is Easier Than You Think</strong></h4><p>Many non-residents assume that setting up an LLC is a complicated process, but in reality, <strong>it’s fast and simple</strong> when you follow the right steps:</p><p>✅ <strong>Choose the Best State</strong> – New Mexico : Our recommendation is <strong>New Mexico</strong>, which is the state with no annual reporting and the lowest cost of entry.<br>✅ <strong>Register Your LLC Online</strong> – You can use a <strong>formation service like Northwest Registered Agent</strong> to handle everything.<br>✅ <strong>Receive Your LLC Documents</strong> – Usually within <strong>1-2 business days</strong>.<br>✅ <strong>Apply for an EIN</strong> – You’ll need this for your <strong>bank account and Stripe registration</strong>.<br>✅ <strong>Open a US Business Bank Account</strong> – Required for receiving payments from Stripe.</p><p>Once these steps are completed, <strong>your US Stripe account will be ready for activation</strong>! 🚀</p><p>In the next section, we’ll cover <strong>how to get a US business address and why it’s required for Stripe registration</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Why Do You Need a US Business Address for a Stripe Account?</strong></h3><p>One of the key requirements for opening a <strong>US Stripe account</strong> as a non-resident is providing a <strong>US business address</strong>.

Without it, Stripe will not recognize your business as a <strong>legitimate US entity</strong>, and your account will not be approved.</p><p>The good news? <strong>Forming an LLC is a straightforward process, and you can do it entirely online!</strong> ✅</p><p>Among the many US states where you can form an LLC, <strong>New Mexico stands out as the best choice for non-residents</strong> due to its <strong>low cost and business-friendly policies</strong>.</p><p>Let’s explore why <strong>New Mexico</strong> is the <strong>most affordable and efficient</strong> option for setting up your LLC.</p><hr><h3><strong>Why New Mexico is the Best State for Your LLC</strong></h3><p>If you're a <strong>non-US resident</strong> looking for the most <strong>cost-effective</strong> and <strong>hassle-free</strong> way to form an LLC, <strong>New Mexico</strong> is an <strong>excellent choice</strong>.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><p>✔️ <strong>No Annual Reports or Renewal Fees</strong> – Unlike most states, <strong>New Mexico does not require LLCs to file annual reports</strong> or pay yearly renewal fees. This saves you time and money.<br>✔️ <strong>No State Taxes for Foreign-Owned LLCs</strong> –If you do not operate a physical store or shop in the United States and do not have a physical office there, you do not pay <strong>state taxes</strong> in New Mexico.<br>✔️ <strong>Low Formation Cost</strong> – The filing fee is <strong>only $50</strong>, making it one of the <strong>cheapest states to form an LLC</strong>.<br>✔️ <strong>Privacy Protection (Anonymous LLC Option)</strong> – <strong>New Mexico LLC owners' names are not publicly listed</strong>, providing an extra layer of privacy.<br>✔️ <strong>Fast &amp; Easy Formation</strong> – The LLC registration process in New Mexico is <strong>quick and straightforward</strong>, with approval typically taking <strong>1-2 business days</strong>.</p><p><strong>With no annual maintenance fees, tax benefits, and strong privacy protection, New Mexico is the ideal choice for non-US residents looking to form a US LLC.</strong></p><p>In the next section, we will break down the <strong>exact step-by-step process</strong> of forming an LLC in New Mexico. 🚀</p><h3><strong>How to Form an LLC in New Mexico (Step-by-Step Guide)</strong></h3><p>Forming an <strong>LLC in New Mexico</strong> is a <strong>simple and fully online process</strong>—even for <strong>non-US residents</strong>.

For example, in <strong>New Mexico</strong>, the <strong>LLC formation filing fee is only $52</strong>—making it one of the most cost-effective options for non-US residents. ✅</p><p>The <strong>quickest and most effective way</strong> to form a <strong>US LLC in New Mexico</strong> is by using a <strong>professional LLC formation service</strong>.</p><p>In this guide, we recommend
